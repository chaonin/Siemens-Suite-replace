The replace SIR object is a member of the Siemens suite of test subjects.
Originally this subject was written for execution under the Sun Microsystems
operating systems (SunOS and Solaris.)  While initially written and executed
on a SunOS4.3 platform and using an unknown compiler, we have found that one
of these inserted faults, v32, is no longer revealed.  When this subject was
originally packaged by the SIR 30 of the tests would reveal the v32 fault.
We can no longer recreate this fault's failing behavior on modern systems,
where it appears that no tests now reveal this fault.

2. genScr4Orig.lua - generate new running script for orig ver of replace
3. versions.alt/versions.orig/genTraceD.py - for trace directory of dot and txt of pvtrace
4. newoutputs/genNewOutpusDir - for generating versions directory of output
5. source.alt/source.orig/Makefile - Makefile for original version
6. all versions of replace.c (because of old version of C/gcc not fit new version of C/gcc now):
  1)在# include <stdio.h>下插入两行
      # include <ctype.h>
      # include <stdlib.h>
  2)修改 # define NULL 0 为 # define NUL 0 ( NULL 为关键字）
  3)将所有的 getline 替换为 get_line
7. add instrument.c to versions.alt/versions.orig/vX(all 32 versions of repace.c) for pvtrace
8. add genSpectDir.py for dirs of spectrum
9. add finalresults/xx  dir and final results of all testing
10. add diff.sh for gether the results' diff of orig and all versions
11. add scripts/run.sh for running of all versions
12. add setup.sh for preparing runtine of running test 
13. bugplaceofallv.txt - the bug line of all versions
14. add papers - related papers
15. spectrum-vo-v1-15.tar.gz spectrum results part I
    spectrum-v16-32.tar.gz   spectrum results part II
16. add dir handleresult and handleresult/process.py to handle the metrics for all method:Jaccard, Ochiai,...

How to run:
1. sh setup.sh
2. sh scripts/runall.sh  # run all 5542 test case for original version
3. sh scripts/run_vX.sh  # X = 1, 2, 3...32 run version X of replace.c
